# Memorandum of Understanding - ToS;DR - Phoenix 0.3.4-Alpha

In November 2017, the team of the Terms of Service;Didn't Read ('ToS;DR') project was approached by DuckDuckGo,
with the proposal of making a donation to help us get the project back on the rails. This donation
was channeled through CrowdRise, Edward Charles Foundation, and Commons Conservancy, with the goal
of reaching the ToS;DR team. Encouraged by this donation, the team has developed a new version of the review tool,
in Ruby on Rails instead of Meteor, and has also reached out to the project's community, and to press journalists.

Since the switch to Ruby, the review tool has been named Phoenix, and on 15 May, we published an alpha version of it,
labeled 0.3.4.
Therefore, the scope of this MoU is 'Phoenix 0.3.4-Alpha'.

The source code which resulted from this MoU's work was pubished on 10 May 2018 at
https://github.com/tosdr/phoenix/releases/tag/v0.3.4.0-alpha and subsequently put into production on https://edit.tosdr.org

This memorandum of understanding documents in great detail how the project team has spent the first 7215 euros of this
donation. In Q4, Q1, and the first half of Q2, we spent 2608, 3468, and 1139 euros respectively, adding up to the 7215 euro
total of this MoU.

We therefore think it is clear that the work described here has actually happened, in keeping with the project's charitable goals,
and a Request For Payment for the same amount, payable to our current team lead Michiel de Jong, is attached.

Specifically, the following activities happened in this light, between 1 October 2017 (start of 2017-Q4) and 15
May 2018 (halfway 2018-Q2):
